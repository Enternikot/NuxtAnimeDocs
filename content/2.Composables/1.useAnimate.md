# useAnimate

``useAnimate`` is the best Entry for your Animations.  <br/>
To register your animation, utilize the `useAnimate`composable and provide the necessary `AnimationParams`.
This will return a ``ref`` of `JSAnimation` , which includes all the relevant keys as well as methods for managing the animation.
For more detailed information regarding the animation object, please refer to the [Anime.js V4 Documatation](https://animejs.com/documentation/animation).

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>

const box = useTemplateRef("box");
const anim = await useAnimate(box, {
  autoplay: false,
  x: 100,
  rotate: 360,
});
</script>
```

## Anime.js Mehtods - Stagger
Sometime you want to group up your Elemts and want to animate them in a Stagger way.
Anime.js have some great ``Methods`` to support a felxible way for that.
You can add easly add function form the base Libabry easly into your `AnimationParams`.

Like now we can create a easy Stagger Animation:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-for="i of 10" :key="i" ref="boxes" class="box" />
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
import { stagger } from "animejs";

const boxes = ref();
useAnimate(boxes, {
  x: 320,
  rotate: -180,
  ease: "inOutQuint",
  loop: true,
  alternate: true,
  delay: stagger(65, {
    from: "center",
  }),
});
</script>

```
